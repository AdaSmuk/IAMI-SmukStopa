      <p id="desc">This is the workshop where it all started.<br>
        Back in 2014 we decided that our life have to take a big turn, 
        so we can finally start making our dreams come true.<br>
        We turned an old cabin at the back of my parents house
        into a workshop, in which we created our first and most popular hair pin design.<br>
        Right now it's bigger and better, with a small warehouse where we store and prepare all types of leathers.<br>
        It's also a place where most of your orders are created.</p>

      <p id="desc">Our second workshop, founded after our student moved to England.<br>
        We wanted to keep in touch and expand our business together so we bought a small warehouse to turn it into another workshop and shipping center.<br>
        If you live over sea or in any country to which shipping is better from England your orders first fly right there.<br>
        If anything is not right when your order arrives in England, we can repair it or even make a new one.<br>
